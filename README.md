# pantsu's hashlips

This is a heavily modified HashLips Art Engine, it has lots of "improvements", such as:

- Multi layer traits
- Traits restrictions with config rules (with TAGS as well as names!)
- RNG seed option
- Custom canvas backgrounds (and a new canvas engine that supports more canvas features)
- Absolutely no documentation whatsoever
